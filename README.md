# Pokemon-Type

## About

This website allows the user to search for Pokémon and retrieve information about it's type, and also see a neat small image of the Pokémon. It uses the Poké API available at https://pokeapi.co and was built using the Bootstrap library (for it's enjoyably easy responsive grid layout) and vanilla JS.
